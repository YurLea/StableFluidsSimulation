# StableFluidsSimulation
Modified Stable fluids algorithm. Inspired by the articles: https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/public_user/stam/reality/Research/pdf/ns.pdf and https://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/nsp/course/15-464/Spring11/papers/StamFluidforGames.pdf

## Usage

1. Open terminal
2. go to StableFluids directory
3. Run command

```console
python test.py
```

##

After that you will see default scenario of simulation
